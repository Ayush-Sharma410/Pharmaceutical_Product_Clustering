## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of pharmaceutical product information, including:
- Medicine names
- Dosages
- Forms
- Sources

The data is sourced from various pharmaceutical suppliers, and it is organized into clusters based on the similarity of the medicine names.

## Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing steps include:
- Cleaning and standardizing the medicine names
- Handling missing data
- Creating a consistent naming format
- Assigning cluster labels to each product

## Clustering

The clustering process involves:
- Using RapidFuzz and PolyFuzz for matching similar product names
- Creating clusters and subclusters for each product
- Organizing the products into coherent groups

## File Structure

The project's file structure includes:
- The dataset in CSV format
- Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing and clustering
- The final clustered dataset in CSV format
- This README file

## Usage

To use the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.
2. Run the Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing and clustering.
3. Access the final clustered dataset for your analysis or applications.
